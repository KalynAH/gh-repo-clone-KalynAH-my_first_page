Hi All, This was my very first static  web page in 2018 that I built using HTML, CSS  and JavaScript.
I was taking a Web Fundamentals course at Eastern Gateway Community College, the class was IDM 111 Web Languages.
This course was under the colleges degree program for IDM- Internet Design Media program.
The class required a final project this application was influenced by a friend who owned a bar in my neighborhood that wanted me to build his website!
He had a bar and grill but I created a fake one for the college where I took the course,Eastern Gateway Community College Go Gators! The theme is our mascot and colors!
After taking the class, I was a bit lost because the program IDM is not a full stack  or server side program, it's more digital/web design focus so all the
languages going forward was front end. I wanted to learn back end so I took the course got an A but I wasn't sure what to do next with this knowledge. 
I REALLY wanted to learn the backend and stubmled across Coding Dojo in 2023. This application although simple, is what got me started into programming!
Take a look at my schools virtual Bar & Grille!
